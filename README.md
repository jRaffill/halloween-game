# halloween-game

In 2020, my friends requested that I make a virtual trick-or-treat experience to make up
for the lack of an in-person one. They designed it and with my small amount of JavaScript
experience I did my best to create what they had envisioned. 

Each house you come to will either give you a random amount of candy, or be inhabited by
vampires who steal all of your candy. Level up to impress houses and increase your candy
multiplier, and get to level 10 (creepy clown) to scare the vampires so much that you are
finally able to trick-or-treat in peace.
